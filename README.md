3. (2 pts) Write a complete program in a cpp file that prompts the user to enter a number
within the range of 1 through 10. Use a switch statement to display the Roman
numerical version of that number. Your program must also implement input validation
(assume the user will at least enter numbers): Do not accept a number less than 1 or
greater than 10.

4. (4 pts) Write a complete program in a cpp file that simulates a basic calculator. The
program should prompt the user to enter two numbers and an arithmetic operation. The
valid operations are:
● + (Addition)
● - (Subtraction)
● * (Multiplication)
● / (Division)
Use a switch statement to perform the specified operation and output the result. The
program must also implement input validation (assume the user will at least enter
numbers or single characters), check if the user tried to divide by zero, and output an
appropriate error message.
Sample input and output:
1. Input:
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 89
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): +
Output:
Result: 99
2. Input:
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 0
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): /
Output:
Error: Division by zero
3. Input:
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 12
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): ^
Output:
Error: Invalid operation
